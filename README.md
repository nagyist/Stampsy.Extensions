Stampsy.Extensions
==================

This is meant to be a small "misc utils" library for MonoTouch that makes some UIKit/Foundation API more C#-friendly.  
It contains friendlier wrappers around some MonoTouch classes/methods and fairly popular extension methods.

My rule of thumb for inclusion of a class or method is that:

- it should be the kind of thing that isn't in the framework but is commonly requested and has lots of upvotes on SO;
- it involves little to no abstraction and is a really thin wrapper above Apple classes.

Contributions are welcome, if they satisfy both criteria.
